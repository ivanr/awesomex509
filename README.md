Uses of X.509 Certificates
==========================

X.509 Certificates are primarily known due to their use in TLS/SSL, but there are plenty
of other places where they play a role.

Background
==========

I am interested in the security of cryptographic public keys and the developer of
[badkeys](https://badkeys.info/), a tool to check for known-insecure cryptographic keys.

X.509 certificates are a very common use case of public key cryptography, and they are
used in a wide variety of ecosystems. I am unaware of any existing overview of the many
different use cases of X.509. Therefore, I started this document to collect this
information.
